## **GSoC'21 : NumFOCUS**

In response to my contributions for about 4 months to [***SciML Org***](https://github.com/SciML), I was absolutely thrilled when informed about my selection in this year's **GSoC** on 17th May, 2021. I'll be working for [***NumFOCUS***](https://numfocus.org/) under the mentorship of [***Chris Rackauckas***](https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas), [***Yingbo Ma***](https://github.com/YingboMa) & [***Kanav Gupta***](https://github.com/kanav99).

_Letter of Acceptance_ -

A big thanks to Chris for helping me acclimatize with the library, educating about the API 
standards and addressing the silliest of queries I've had. 

Special mention to [***Utkarsh***](https://github.com/utkarsh530/) who was there, ready to help at odd hours without complaining. He was the
one who suggested me to work for SciML and pushed the idea of application altogether.
It couldn't have been possible without him!


### _The Proposal_

My work would revolve mainly around enhancement of the [***DiffEqOperators.jl***](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqOperators.jl) package. It
has been designated to build operators for FD-discretization of PDEs alongside automated
handling of symbolically defined PDEs. You can find the proposal [***here***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-eGbu8bG8GkSOYYZfApMCppYqQvuPteF/view?usp=sharing).
The substantial deliverables include :

- **Addition of new Vector Calculus Operators**
- **Enhancement of the symbolic handling framework MOLFiniteDifference**
- **Optimization and expansion of concretizations for operators**

Coding period will be beginning from 7th June, before which I plan to refine some of these goals
as the codebase has progressed since the application.

Google being the best of workplaces with an amazing OS community, I hope to bag a lot of take aways from this
endeavour and plan on to remain a committed member for as long as I can.
